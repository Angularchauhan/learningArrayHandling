            3. What will be output for below code and why
            [1,2,4,5,11,12,22,23,31].sort()

            Ans: Output will be : [1,11,12,2,22,23,31,4,5]
            Because it sorts the array in alphabetical order.

            12. What is ceil and floor function and what is use of them.
            Ans:
            ceil rounds up the value to its nearest integer.
            floor rounds down the values to its nearest integer.
        -->

        <!--
            13. What is round and how it is different from ceil and floor.
            Ans:
            round() rounds the value to its nearest integer depend on number given after decimal. It works as mathematical round off, thats why it differ from ceil and floor.

        <!--
        14. What will be output for below codes and give Ans for output.

1. 1 + “2” + “2”
->"122" Ans: as "2" is string and operator is +, 1 will be converted to string and concatination will happen i.e. "12" & "12"+"2"="122"

2. 1+2+3 +”4”
->"64"Ans: 1+2+3=6 & 6+"4"=64 as 6 will be converted to string and concatination will happen 

3. “4” + true
->"4true"Ans: as "4" is string, true will be converted to string and concatination will happen 

4. “True” + true
->"Truetrue"Ans: as "True" is string, true will be converted to string and concatination will happen  

5. 1 + true
->2Ans: as 1 is number, true will be converted to 1 by automatic type conversion 

6. 2 + false
->2Ans: Numeric value of false is 0, so 2+0=2

7. "4" * true
->4Ans: As operator is multiplication,  "4" is getting converted to number and numeric value of true is 1, so 4*1=4

8. 4 * “Af”
->NaNAns: As "Af" is not a number and can't be converted to number, output will be not a number

9. "4" * "A"
->NaNAns: As "A" is not a number and can't be converted to number, output will be not a number

10. “4”*”4”
->16Ans: as "4" can be converted to number, due to * operator both will be converted to number so 4*4=16

11. 4 + "4A" +10
->"44A10"Ans: as + operator, 4+"4A"="44A" and as "44A" is string, 10 will be converted to string and concatination will happen

12. 4 + "4" * 10
->44Ans: It will give priority to * operator, so "4"*10 will execute first. "4" will be considered as number and output will be 40. Now 4+40 will execute and output will be 44

13. 4 + "4A" * 10
->NaNAns: It will give priority to * operator, so "4A"*10 will execute first and output will be NaN. so 4+NaN=NaN (Any number operated with NaN will NaN) 

14. 4 + "true" * 10
->NaNAns: It will give priority to * operator, so "true"*10 will execute first and output will be NaN, as "true" is string and can't be converted to number. So 4+NaN=NaN

15. true *80
->80Ans: as true is boolean, numeric value of true is 1. So 1*80=80 

16. 1 +2+ 3+ "ad"
->"6ad"Ans:1+2+3=6 & 6+"4"=64 as 6 will be converted to string and concatination will happen

17. "1" +2+ 3
->"123"Ans: As we have only + operator in expression, it will execute from left to right. Now as "1" is string, 2 will be converted to string and concatination will happen. out will be "12", "12"+3 will be again "123" 

18. "1" *2+ 3+8*"true"
->NaNAns: "1"*2 will be 2 as "1" will be converted to number and out put will be 2. Later 8*"true" will execute and output will be NaN as "true" is not a number. Later any operation with NaN will retrun NaN

19. true*0 + "false"
->"0false"Ans: First true*0 will excute and output will be 0 as numeric of true will be 1. 0+"false" will be"0false" as "false" is string & 0 will be converted to string

20. 1*2+3+8+"true"
->"13true"Ans: first 1*2 will execute and output will be 2. Now it will execute left to right. So 2+3=5,5+8=13 and 13+"true"="13true" as "true" is string and 13 will be converted to string

21. 1 *null + true+10 + "10"
->"1110"Ans: anything multiply by null is zero, 0 +true=1 (true converted to numeric), 1+10=11, 11+"11"="1110" (11 converted to string)
